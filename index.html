        <p>   We are hackers, a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical </p>
        <p>   knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means.</p>
        <p>   Though the term hacker has become associated in popular culture with a security hacker </p>
        <p>   someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data</p>

        <p>   For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals</p>
        <p>   and employed by State actors as a weapon of both legal and illegal warfare.</p>

        <p>   identities online, posing as criminals themselves.Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques</p>
        <p>   in the legal conduct of their work. Oppositely, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by</p>
        <p>   law enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless activities), </p>
